  "readme": "# Docker\n\nA documentation generator built on the foundations of [Docco](http://jashkenas.github.com/docco/) and [Docco-Husky](https://github.com/mbrevoort/docco-husky).\n\nThe support available in Docco and Docco-Husky for larger projects consisting of many hundreds of script files was somewhat lacking, so I decided to create my own.\n\nTake a look at this project's [public page](http://jbt.github.com/docker) for an example of what it can do.\n\n## Installation\n\nSimple: `npm install -g docker`\n\nRequires [Pygments](http://pygments.org/)\n\n## Usage\n\n```sh\n$ docker [options] [files ...]\n```\n\nAvailable options are:\n\n * `-i` or `--input_dir`: Path to input source directory. Defaults to current directory.\n * `-o` or `--output_dir`: Path to output doc directory. Defaults to `./doc`.\n * `-u` or `--updated_files`: If present, only process files that hav been changed.\n * `-c` or `--colour_scheme` (yes, I'm British): Colour scheme to use. Colour schemes are as below.\n * `-I` or `--ignore_hidden`: Ignore files and directories whose names begin with `.` or `_`.\n * `-w` or `--watch`: Keep the process running, watch for changes on the directory, and process updated files.\n * `-s` or `--sidebar`: Whether or not the sidebar should be opened by default in the output (defaults to yes, can be yes, no, true, false)\n * `-x` or `--exclude`: Comma-separated list of paths to exclude. Supports basic `*` wildcards too.\n\nIf no file list is given, docker will run recursively on every file in the current directory\n\nAny of the files given can also be directories, in which case it will recurse into them.\n\nFolder structure inside the input directory is preserved into the output directory and file names are simply appended `.html` for the doc file\n\n## Examples\n\nIf you haven't installed with `-g` specified, replace `docker` with something like `$(npm root)/docker/docker` in all of the examples below.\n\n### Process every file in the current directory into \"doc\"\n\n```sh\n$ docker\n```\n\n### Process files in \"src\" to \"documents\"\n\n```sh\n$ docker -i src -o documents\n```\nor:\n```sh\n$ docker -o documents src\n```\nor:\n```sh\n$ docker -o documents src/*\n```\n\nNote that in the first example, the contents of `src` will be mapped directly into `documents` whereas in the second and third\nexamples, the files will be created inside `documents/src`\n\n### Generate Docker docs\n\nThis is the command I use to generate [this project's documentation](http://jbt.github.com/docker).\n\n * Output to a directory on the `gh-pages` branch of this repo\n * Use the \"manni\" colour scheme\n * Ignore files starting with `_` or `.`\n * Only process updated files\n * Exclude the node_modules directory\n * Watch the directory for further changes as the code is updated.\n\n```sh\n$ docker -o ../docker_gh-pages -c manni -I -u -x node_modules --watch\n```\n\n\n## Colour Schemes\n\nThese are exactly as in `pygmentize -L styles`:\n\n * monokai\n * manni\n * rrt\n * perldoc\n * borland\n * colorful\n * default\n * murphy\n * vs\n * trac\n * tango\n * fruity\n * autumn\n * bw\n * emacs\n * vim\n * pastie\n * friendly\n * native\n\n\n## Important note\n\nAll files must be inside the input directory (specified by `-i`) or one of its descendant subdirectories. If they're not then it'll just get horribly confused and get into an infinite loop. Which isn't nice.",
